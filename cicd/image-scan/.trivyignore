# Issue related to outdated protobufjs dependency. It's a grandchild dependency
# of @firebase/firestore and so it's nothing we can patch on our end, nor
# something we're currently willing to submit a pull request for as it would
# involve updating to a new major version.
#
# The vulnerability would require a GRPC contributor to create a malicious
# `.proto` file and merge it into the project, which seems unlikely, so for now
# let's accept the risk.
